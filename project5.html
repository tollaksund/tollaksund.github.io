    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <img src="urchinator.jpg" alt="Urchin Remover Image">
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong>  
    This project was developed in collaboration with the environmental foundation Bellona as part of a course in product development. The goal was to create a prototype for a robotic device capable of detecting and safely removing invasive sea urchins from the ocean floor. These urchins are a major threat to kelp forests and marine biodiversity in Norway. The system included mechanical components for gripping and collecting urchins, an underwater-compatible structure, and considerations for sustainable deployment in real-world conditions.

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>
      The design was iteratively developed through CAD modeling, simulation, and 3D printing. Key focus areas included underwater actuation, sensor integration for detection, and modular assembly for ease of maintenance. Emphasis was also placed on environmental safety and non-disruptive removal techniques.

    <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The prototype demonstrated the feasibility of automated sea urchin removal and highlighted the importance of robotics in sustainable marine resource management. The project helped raise awareness of marine ecosystem restoration and formed the basis for further exploration into scalable deployment strategies.
