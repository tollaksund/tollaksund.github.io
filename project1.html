    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img src="VarehusRobot_cover.jpg" alt="Warehouse Robot Cover">
    <p>
      This robot was developed to autonomously navigate a warehouse, detect obstacles, and deliver items.
      Using a combination of ultrasonic sensors, wheel encoders, and line-following techniques, it can operate efficiently in structured environments.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>
      The chassis was designed in Fusion 360 and 3D-printed. The electronics were prototyped using an Arduino-based system, and the robot was tested in multiple indoor setups.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Obstacle detection and avoidance</li>
      <li>Line-following navigation</li>
      <li>Delivery compartment with servo control</li>
      <li>Modular and maintainable chassis design</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The robot operates using a structured navigation system divided into three stages: locating the item, grabbing it, and delivering it to the packing bay. Each stage includes substages and is supported by a finite state machine that ensures smooth transitions and recovery if a task fails. The robot uses a model-based reflex agent to make decisions based on both current and past sensor input.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance</h2>
    <p>
      The navigation system converts sensor inputs into motor outputs, enabling the robot to move, rotate, and avoid obstacles in real-time. It integrates with the vision system to activate only necessary sensors, optimizing performance on the Raspberry Pi. A dual strategy combining <strong>potential fields</strong> and <strong>Bug 2 algorithms</strong> allows the robot to maintain a smooth trajectory toward the target while dynamically avoiding obstacles.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Potential Fields:</strong> Smooth, intuitive navigation toward targets with obstacles treated as repelling forces.</li>
      <li><strong>Bug 2 Algorithm:</strong> Boundary-following strategy to navigate around obstacles when encountered at close range.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Operational Stages</h2>
    <p><strong>Stage 1 – Item Location:</strong> The robot scans for row markers using the packing bay as a reference. It avoids blind zones and stabilizes between shelves for accurate vision input.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 2 – Item Pickup:</strong> The robot raises the grabber, aligns with the item, and picks it up using focused visual input.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 3 – Delivery:</strong> The robot drives to the packing bay while avoiding obstacles and releases the item, then resets for the next cycle.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Performance and Validation</h2>
    <p>
      During tests, the robot demonstrated successful autonomous behavior, consistently retrieving and delivering items. The integration of mobility and vision systems allowed for robust obstacle avoidance and precise navigation. In real-world trials, the robot achieved a success rate of approximately 75%, with minor inconsistencies attributed to lighting, traction, and battery variation.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This project helped develop skills in embedded programming, sensor integration, and mechanical design. It also emphasized the importance of robust testing and iterative development.
