    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <img src="VarehusRobot_cover.jpg" alt="Warehouse Robot Cover">
    <p>
      This robot was developed to autonomously navigate a warehouse, detect obstacles, and deliver items.
      It uses angle-based navigation derived from fixed landmarks (such as packing bays and shelves), paired with a finite state machine and real-time sensor input processed by a model-based reflex agent.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>
      The chassis was designed in Fusion 360 and 3D-printed. The electronics were prototyped using an Arduino-based system, and the robot was tested in multiple indoor setups. The robot logic was implemented on a Raspberry Pi running a modular navigation system.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Model-based reflex navigation system</li>
      <li>Vision-based item detection and alignment</li>
      <li>Obstacle avoidance using Bug 2 and potential fields</li>
      <li>Servo-controlled item collection and delivery</li>
      <li>Modular and maintainable chassis and code architecture</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>System Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The robot operates using a structured navigation system divided into three stages: locating the item, grabbing it, and delivering it to the packing bay. Each stage includes substages and is supported by a finite state machine that ensures smooth transitions and recovery if a task fails. The robot uses a model-based reflex agent to make decisions based on both current and past sensor input, improving reliability in real-time operation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance</h2>
    <p>
      The navigation system converts sensor inputs into motor commands, enabling the robot to turn, drive straight, or correct its path. A hybrid method is used: <strong>potential fields</strong> for smooth long-range movement, and <strong>Bug 2</strong> for close-range obstacle avoidance. This allows the robot to maintain a smooth trajectory while dynamically responding to its environment.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bug 2 Algorithm:</strong> Follows the edge of an obstacle until a clear path to the goal is found, ensuring reliable obstacle circumvention.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential Fields:</strong> Obstacles act as repelling forces and the goal as an attractor, resulting in fluid motion toward the target.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operational Stages</h2>
    <p><strong>Stage 1 – Item Location:</strong> The robot scans for the packing bay and row markers. It avoids blind zones and aligns using shelf angles to reach a stable scanning zone.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 2 – Item Pickup:</strong> It raises the grabber, aligns with the detected item, and drives forward to activate the pick-up mechanism.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 3 – Delivery:</strong> The robot navigates back toward the packing bay using shelf alignment and vision input. Upon arrival, it drops the item and resets the FSM.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Performance and Validation</h2>
    <p>
      During real-world tests, the robot successfully retrieved and delivered items with a success rate of approximately 75%. It demonstrated robust integration between navigation, obstacle avoidance, and vision systems. Variability in lighting, battery level, and floor traction occasionally impacted reliability but did not prevent task completion.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This project helped develop skills in embedded programming, sensor integration, and mechanical design. It also emphasized the importance of structured architecture, real-time decision-making, and robust testing. The model-based reflex agent combined with finite state logic proved effective in coordinating complex autonomous behavior in a constrained environment.
